Five main topics will be covered: general engineering principles behind high performance numerical computing (including the use of accelerators like GPUs); state-vector simulation techniques; tensor network theory and practice; fast simulation of Clifford circuits and error correcting codes; quantum error mitigation with [Mitiq](https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq).

Most of the practice will be in the Julia programming language due to the ease with which one can introduce low-level high-performance constructs in it, without losing the dynamic nature and ease of prototyping available in languages like Python. However, practical tips and guides will be provided for programming in Python, Rust, and C/C++, as well.

Multiple hackathons, will be available in the evenings, providing opportunities to work on personal research projects with the help of the instructors, and with bounties available for work on open source projects.

The summer school will end with multiple showcases, workshops, and hackathons from academic and industry partners, demonstrating how the techniques discussed during the summer school are currently applied at the cutting edge of science.

On Saturday August 17th, members of the [Unitary Fund](unitary.fund) technical team will host a workshop on quantum error mitigation (QEM) with the software package [Mitiq](https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq).
We will cover QEM core concepts and techniques and the Mitiq structure and interface, with a deep dive into the techniques of Zero Noise Extrapolation and Digital Dynamical Decoupling. 
In the later part of the session, we will explore QEM on simulated noisy backends with benchmarks and calibration.
The workshop will conclude in the evening with a Mitiq hackathon. 

In the extended sessions we will cover many of the following topics:
